Albania was never on my bucket list and I barely knew anything about the country. I just happened to watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_BCdZUxRI8" target="_blank">video from Yes Theory</a> about Albania. As someone who enjoys travelling to less ordinary places where people I know have never really heard of, Albania piqued my interest after watching that video. Many people I met along the way were surprised Albania is only the 2nd European country that I visited so far back then. This might be unconventional, but I always feel that people should visit countires where many tourists don't know yet. Travelling to a country with little tourists feels like you have the entire place to yourself and it is so peaceful.

Albania gave me a good feeling that it is one of those mysterious countries that I will not be dissappointed. Hence, my impulsive self decided to start off my grad trip in Albania. I spent 2 weeks in this beautiful country and it is definitely one of my favoruite countries that I've been. The country has every element that makes it one of the best countries to visit. I am going to share with you 5 reasons why you should put Albania into your bucket list right now!

## 1. It is cheap

The average cost per day required to travel in a country is always one of the top factor that I would keep in mind before deciding my next destination.

## 2. Mountains and Beaches

## Final thoughts

**It's cheaper.** Most cloud "getting started" guides will show you how to spin up a serverâ€”a mercenary rented computer that stays online 24/7 to do your bidding.

But for most of my projects, I'm going utilize technology that doesn't require a hosted server. In particular:

| Service  | Purpose        |
| -------- | -------------- |
| S3       | File storage   |
| DynamoDB | Database       |
| Lambda   | Compute engine |

Their on-demand pricing means the cost scales with usage. There is a [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc), and it only begins to cost money if usage exceeds a certain amount.

For small projects with light traffic, this usually translates to monthly costs of **less than a dollar** (if not completely free).

In comparison, the price of hosting a server typically starts at **$5.00 per month**.

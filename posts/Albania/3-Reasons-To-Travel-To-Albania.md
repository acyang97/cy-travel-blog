Albania was never on my bucket list and I barely knew anything about the country. I just happened to watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_BCdZUxRI8" target="_blank">video from Yes Theory</a> about Albania. As someone who enjoys travelling to less ordinary places where people I know have never really heard of, Albania piqued my interest after watching that video. Many people I met along the way were surprised Albania is only the 2nd European country that I visited so far back then. This might be unconventional, but I always feel that people should visit countires where many tourists don't know yet. Travelling to a country with little tourists feels like you have the entire place to yourself and it is so peaceful.

Albania gave me a good feeling that it is one of those mysterious countries that I will not be disappointed. Hence, my impulsive self decided to start off my grad trip in Albania. I spent 2 weeks in this beautiful country and it is definitely one of my favoruite countries that I've been. The country has every element that makes it one of the best countries to visit. I am going to share with you 5 reasons why you should put Albania into your bucket list right now!

## 1. It is cheap

Albania is a cheap country to travel to, dirt cheap. The average cost per day required to travel in a country is always one of the top factor that I would keep in mind before deciding my next destination. I always believe a country is much more enjoyable if I am able to have fun without spending too much.

You can definitely get around Albania with an average spending of about $40-50 SGD per day. Note that this is coming from an experience as a solo backpacker who always stays on the budget. The average cost per meal should be around 500 Lek, and you can easily find a hostel that costs around 1000 Lek per night.

As for transport, you will most likely be taking buses to get from one city to another most of the time. Just for gauging, a 4 hour bus journey from Tirana to Berat costs 400 Lek.

## 2. Mountains and Beaches

Albania probably doesn't come to people's mind if they were asked to recommend places with nice beaches and mountains to go for a holiday. This country is truly a hidden gem offering a breathtaking mix of stunning beaches, majestic mountains, and picturesque landscapes. It's a destination that has something for everyone, whether you are an adventure seeker, beach lover, or simply looking for a relaxing getaway.

Albania itself is a mountainous region. Most people go for hiking at the Albanian Alps at the north. However, you will see mountains everywhere else in the country when you are sitting on the buses.

On the coastal part of Albania, you got the Albanian Riviera. The coast of Albania is along the Adriatic coast, and it this region, you will be able to find stunning beaches with some of the bluest water that you can find in the world. These are also some of the quietest beaches that you can find, as tourism has not hit Albania too much yet.

## 3. The People

Even though there is a language barrier as Albanians are not the best in English, the people there would still try their best to help and understand your needs if you ask them for help. There are too many occasions during my time there where people were so nice that I felt bad for their kindness.

One such occasion was during a hike organised by my hostel in the outskirts of Gjirokastër, we walked past a village and was invited in by one family that my group came accross. The family shared some stories about their background as well as their time back during Communism when Albania was still led by Enver Hoxha. It was an cool experience listening to the stories of Albanians and they even offered beer and chocolates! I've already heard of many horror stories regarding the communism period in Albania, but these stories are always more interesting when hearing them from the people themselves.

I talked to many other travellers, and it sounds like it is not uncommon for people to invite you to their house and offer you some drinks. You will understand and feel the warmth of the Albanian people as soon as you reach the country.

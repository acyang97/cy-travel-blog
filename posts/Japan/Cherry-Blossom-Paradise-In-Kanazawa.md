This was not my first time in Kanazawa. I went there for the first time back in 2016 before my national service. However, this time, I wanted to go there as part of my Sakura Hunting journey in Japan. As the Sakura season started much earlier in 2023 and I only reached Japan in 2 April, I have already missed the peak blossom in major cities like Tokyo, which was why I decided to immediately go to Kanazawa, since the [Sakura forecast](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2167.html) predicted that the Sakura season starts later there.

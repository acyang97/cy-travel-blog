This is my 4th time to Korea (3rd time was just a short layover though), but this was my first time going to Jeju. I have always ignored Jeju because of I felt it was troublesome to go there since I needed to take a domestic flight. However, since I had the time now after losing my job, I decided to finally give Jeju a chance.

Then the question came, how should I explore Jeju? I know most people would rent a car to drive around, however this was impossible for me as I do not have a driving license yet. The idea of going around the island by public transport wasn't particularly exciting to me as well as I've heard from friends regarding how infrequent buses are in Jeju (which wasn't as bad to be honest, but a story for another time). Also, Jeju being such a common tourist destination, I wanted to explore it in a different way unlike other tourists, a way that is crazier and less common.

Then, before leaving for Jeju, I took my phone and saw that Jeju isn't very big in size and it might be possible to cycle around the island! After doing a quick search on google, this definitely seems possible and I was quickly excited by the idea! It was possible to cycle along the [Jeju Fantasy Bicycle Path](https://www.koreabybike.com/routes/jeju-fantasy-bicycle-path/), a 234km cycling route along the circumference of the island!

## Day 0 - Finding a bike

Day 0, I reached Jeju by 3pm from Busan, and my first mission was to find a bike. I first checked in to my hostel, [Jeju Guesthouse](https://www.google.com/travel/search?q=jeju%20guesthouse&g2lb=2502548%2C2503771%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4284970%2C4291517%2C4306835%2C4308226%2C4597339%2C4757164%2C4814050%2C4850738%2C4864715%2C4874190%2C4886490%2C4893075%2C4920132%2C4924070%2C4965990%2C4985712%2C4990494%2C72248281%2C72262102%2C72266483%2C72266484%2C72271797%2C72272556%2C72281254&hl=en-SG&gl=sg&cs=1&ssta=1&ts=CAESCAoCCAMKAggDGhwSGhIUCgcI5w8QBhgTEgcI5w8QBhgUGAEyAhAAKgcKBToDU0dE&qs=CAEyE0Nnb0k4WktseWRLUC1mWUZFQUU4CkILCXFJKSl95O0FGAFCCwl1r7Ix1BB7cxgBQgsJohT02Il01ZYYAVoCCAE&ap=aAG6AQhvdmVydmlldw&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwiw0OzkwMT_AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQDQ).

The owner of the guesthouse was super helpful as he helped me recommend a place to rent a bike. The place he recommended me was called 박스앤자전거 (if you can read korean), just 5 minutes walk from the guesthouse. The owner of the guesthouse was super nice as he helped me call the bicycle rental shop before I left, and found out that they were closed today, but promised that they are open and will have a MTB bike avaialble for 23,000 won per day.

After being assured that I will have a bike, I spent the rest of the day packing a smaller bag for my 4 day cycling trip, resting and going to Uniqlo to buy a UV protective jacket for the upcoming day.

Now I will share an overview of my cycling trip. I posted a video on each day of my cycling trip too which I have linked them too.

## Day 1 - Jeju City (제주시) to Daejeong (대정)

<figure style="text-align:center">
  <center><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/zHaoQUqTgVRyao5aPR7rcg/4d753fa7-c51a-423e-0f8d-2c1609478800/public" alt="Day 1 map" style="width:100%;margin:0" align="center"></center>
  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Day 1 map</b></figcaption>
</figure>

I started from Jeju City 제주시 and cycled 65km to Daejeong 대정, which is a small port at the south west of the island. I was immediately greeted by the scent of the ocean after cycling from the bike shop to the coast and I was amazed. Since the first few km was still relatively near to the city, the roads were still pretty congested with pedestrains. Hence, I only made more stops after cycling further out of the city.

My first favorite place was along the coast of Aewol, where there were a number of nice beaches and nice looking cafes along the strip.

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Beach along Aewol</b></figcaption>
</figure>

There was also many groynes (I think) protruding out of the coast with some sort of red structure at the end of it that I have no idea what it is for. Just one of the small things that I'm somehow fascinated too.

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Aewol Coast</b></figcaption>
</figure>

After lunch, I reached Sinchang Windmill Coastal Road, which is a like its name says, a road with many windmills along the road. However, as a Singaporean who does not see much windmills in my life, this is just another small thing that I found very interesting.

<figure style="text-align:center">
  <center><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/zHaoQUqTgVRyao5aPR7rcg/35c57294-9a7f-4754-478b-a7522b143f00/public" alt="Sinchang Windmill Coastal Road" style="width:90%;margin:0" align="center"></center>
  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Sinchang Windmill Coastal Road</b></figcaption>

After cycling pass the windmills, I continued to my end point for the day at Daejeong.

## Day 2 - To Seogwipo 서귀포!

<figure style="text-align:center">
  <center><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/zHaoQUqTgVRyao5aPR7rcg/c3d0cce7-a279-4db8-d524-f9a4cd7ea700/public" alt="Day 2 map" style="width:100%;margin:0" align="center"></center>
  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Day 2 map</b></figcaption>

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Start of the day!</b></figcaption>
</figure>

It is only around 45km to Seogwipo, hence I could take my time to stop at as many places as I want to for the second day. Day 2 was not my favorite day to be honest. More than half of the 45 km route was inland, and I definitely prefer cyling along the coast.

<figure style="text-align:center">
  <center><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/zHaoQUqTgVRyao5aPR7rcg/c9544795-29aa-4c26-f5cf-5e5931e16e00/public" alt="Coast along Songaksan" style="width:90%;margin:0" align="center"></center>
  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Coast along Songaksan</b></figcaption>
</figure>

One of the few things that was beautiful in day 2 was Songaksan. The coast around the small hill was beautiful, and it got even better when I walk up the trail to the top of the hill.

<figure style="text-align:center">
  <center><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/zHaoQUqTgVRyao5aPR7rcg/54794bee-3dcf-449d-7022-e3e156996900/public" alt="Coast along Songaksan" style="width:90%;margin:0" align="center"></center>
  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Coast along Songaksan</b></figcaption>
</figure>

I probably spent nearly 2 hours here as I was really enjoying the view a lot here.

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Higher point at Songaksan</b></figcaption>
</figure>

After that, I had to stop by at multiple Mega Coffee shops and Mcdonalds to hide from the rain. After a few hours, I finally reached Jusangjeollidae, which is a rugged cliff face formed from volcanic pillars of rock.

<figure style="text-align:center">
  <center><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/zHaoQUqTgVRyao5aPR7rcg/72d0d701-45d4-4e2b-5442-3c5b336a8800/public" alt="Jusangjeollidae" style="width:90%;margin:0" align="center"></center>
  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Jusangjeollidae</b></figcaption>
</figure>

It was honestly quite a boring stretch till I reached Jusangjeollidae, as i was cycling along some sort of mini resort town in Jeju. I was just happy that I finally cycled past it.

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Stopping for a break</b></figcaption>

After Jusangjeollidae, I cycled all the way to Seogwipo, called at early day and had a short nap before going out to walk around the small city.

## Day 3 - To Seongsan 성산

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Day 3 map</b></figcaption>

Day 3 was great as the weather was awesome with blue skies throughout the day. After breakfast, i went to Jeongbang Waterfall, which was just 2km away from where I stayed. Pleasantly surprised it wasn't "just a waterfall". It was pretty beautiful and there was mini rainbow below it as well.

<figure style="text-align:center">
  <center><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/zHaoQUqTgVRyao5aPR7rcg/d7d4b932-0086-4a51-27f1-a685da890400/public" alt="Jeongbang Waterfall" style="width:90%;margin:0" align="center"></center>

After that I made my way to Pyoseon Beach where I'm hoping to reach by noon.

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Spotted another gryone</b></figcaption>

I stopped over for lunch at a place near Pyoseon Beach. I forgot the name of the dish is called, but I enjoyed it. Noodles, mini abalones, interesting broth.

<figure style="text-align:center">
  <center><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/zHaoQUqTgVRyao5aPR7rcg/a480c59f-b687-4360-a7aa-74cc4f54cd00/public" alt="Lunch" style="width:90%;margin:0" align="center"></center>
  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Lunch</b></figcaption>
</figure>

After lunch, I spent some time a cafe near the beach and had some rest, before making my way towards Seongsan.

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Pyoseon beach</b></figcaption>
</figure>

There was another weird strip of land on my way to Seongsan as well. Don't think it has a name, but like it :p

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>I don't know how to describe this</b></figcaption>
</figure>

Before reaching Seongsan, I could already see Seongsan Ilchulbong from far apart, it was more massive than I thought and picturesque.

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight:200;color:black"><b>Seongsan Ilchulbong from afar</b></figcaption>
</figure>

After reaching my hostel and checking in, I spotted a cafe where two dogs whose owners are no where to be found just going towards and jumping to me. Spent some time just hanging around there and dog-watching. Damn I love dogs.

Day 4, I decided to not climb up Seongsan Ilchulbong and come back after my cycling trip as I did not trust my legs.

<figure style="text-align:center">

</figure>

After around 15-20kms, I saw some windmills again near Pyeongdaeri Beach. The sky was much nicer too compared to the first day as the skies were bright and not gloomy at all, so the windmills seemed a lot nicer here.

<figure style="text-align:center">

There was also a cliff where I stopped by because I saw some cows, and moments later from the same place, I looked at the ocean and saw some dolphins swimming too. Check out my instagram video to watch them!

I also chanced upon a restraunt that sells my favorite korean food Dwaeji Gukbap (돼지국밥), basically pork in soup with rice. Simple dish, but I love simple food. I was craving for good 돼지국밥 a lot after leaving Busan, and I'm so happy to find one.

After lunch, I made my way back to Jeju city and returned my bike, and that is the end of my 4-day jeju cycling trip. After returning my bike, I immediately went back to Seongsan as I wanted to climb up Seongsan Ilchulbong and also a day trip to Udo Island, which I will share on another post!

## Where to stay?

There's honestly enough hostels everywhere throughout the island, and they not expensive in my opnion. My Korean friend told me it is because there is an oversupply of accomodations here in Jeju. Hence, I don't think you need to be concern of booking an accomodation in advance. Just decide on the day itself so that you can be more flexible! I only booked my accomodations in the morning of each day before I left my guesthouses. You could also choose to find and book a place to stay whenever you feel like calling it a day.

## How many days should I spend?

I chose to spend 4 days as I have not cycled super long distances multiple days before, and it has been more than a year since I last cycled. I also wanted to take it slow and spend a lot of time stopping to take photos and videos. The total route of the [Jeju Fantasy Bike Path](https://www.koreabybike.com/routes/jeju-fantasy-bicycle-path/) is 234km. You could do ~80km/day and finish the trip in 3 days, or you could do ~60km/day like me and make it a 4 day trip. I highly recommend spending 4 days as there is a lot more than what you expect around the island, hence compelling you to make more stops than you thought

## Where to leave my bags?

Try asking your hostel/hotel at Jeju city if you could leave your bags in their place before your trip. You could check with your bike shop as well. The [bicylce shop](http://www.jejubab.com/index.php) where I rented my bike allowed me to leave my backpack in their shop till I come back.

## What to pack?

Pack super light, especially if your bike shop does not provide you with panniers to put your stuff. For me, the bike shop did not provide one, so I only packed 1 set of shirt and pants for sleeping, 3 underwears, toothbrush & toothpaste, UV jacket, chargers and a laptop (lmao). I brought my laptop for job junting and interview preparation. If you minus away the laptop, your bag should be pretty light and your back should not be so sore even if the bike shop does not provide panniers. No need to worry about towels/toiletries, every accomodation I went to provided it.

## Final thoughts

I was hoping to share as much as possible in tiny details what I did for each day, but I realised this was quite difficult as there were many places where I stopped that was not actually a tourist attraction. This was the beauty of Jeju, everywhere was hoenstly beautiful whether it is an attraction or not. I definitely recommend everyone to explore Jeju by bike. It might not be the cheapest way to do so, but its an expereince I would never forget.

This was my first multi-day cycling trip, and I'm definitely very interested to do another one again soon! It was also my first time spending a period of time without main camera as I did not want that added weight. This was why I finally tried out videography and focused less on photography, which is why the photos seem pretty amateur-ish. Filiming was pretty fun though as I tried to make it more like a story rather then just taking video of random stuff and compiling them. Definitely will do more videography in the future!
